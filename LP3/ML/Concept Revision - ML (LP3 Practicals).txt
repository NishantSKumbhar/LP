**Assignment 1 - ML - Uber Ride price prediction**

# ML:
- Branch of Computer Science, gives computers capability to learn without being externally programmed.

# Types of ML:
1) Supervised Learning:
- Uses 'Labelled' dataset, based on that machine predicts the output.
Eg: Classification & Regression

2) Unsupervised Learning:
- Uses 'Labelled' dataset, based on that machine predicts the output.
- Main aim is to group unsorted dataset according to similarities and patterns.
Eg: Clustering & Association

3) Semi-Supervised Learning:
- Lies between Supervised & Unsupervised learning.
- Combination of 'Labelled' & 'Unlabelled' dataset to predict the output.

4) Reinforcement Learning:
- Feedback is given by AI agent.
- Agent explores surrounding, uses hitting and trial & experiencing things.

# Regression:
- Relationship between Dependent & Independent variable.

# Linear Regression:
- ML algo based on supervised learning.
- Predicts a dependent variable (y) based on a given independent variable (x).
- Graphical reperesentation of linear relationship between x & y.

# Random Forest Algorithm:
- Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm.
- Based on the Supervised learning technique.
- Can be used for both Classification and regression problems in ML.
- Based on Concepts of 'Ensemble Learning'.

# Libraries Used:
1) Numpy: Used for working with arrays and mathematical functions.
2) Pandas: Used for Data analysis.
3) Seaborn and Matplotlib: Data Visualization.
4) Scikit Learn: Statistical Modelling

**Assignment 2 - Email Spam Detection**

# Classification Algorithm:
- Supervised learning technique.
- Identify category of new observations on basis of training data set.
- If Classification problem has --> 2 possible outcomes called as --> 'Binary classifiers'.

# K-nearest Neighbour Algorithm:
- Supervised learning technique
- It stores all --> Avaialaible data & Classifies --> Data points based on similarity.
- New Data appears --> Easily classified --> which category.

# Support Vector machine algorithm:
- Most popular supervised learning technique.
- Works well on classification & regression problems.
- Main aim --> Creating Decision boundary --> Segeregating n-dimensional space into classes.
- Mulitple decision boundries --> Known as 'Hyperplane'.

**Assignment 3 - Neural Network based classifier**

# Neural Network:
- Knwon as ANN or SNN {Articfical/Simulated}
- Subset of ML & Heart of DL.
- Concept --> Making machines work like Humans --> Mimicking like how humans talk & think.
- ANN consists of --> Node layer, input layer, hidden layer, output layer.

#Types:
- Perceptron: Oldest neural network
- Recurrent: Time and series and stock market predictions.

**Assignment 4 - K-nearest Neighbour**

# KNN
- Simplest machine learning algo.
- Assumes similarity between new case data & availaible case data.
- New data appears, easily classified which category to move on.
- used for classification & regression, but mostly used for classification problem.

**Assignment 5 - K-means clustering**

# K-means clustering:
- Unsupervised learning technique.
- Used to solve clustering problems in ML.
- Divides unlabelled dataset into different clusters.
- K is predefined clusters.
- Minimize sum distance between 2 points.
