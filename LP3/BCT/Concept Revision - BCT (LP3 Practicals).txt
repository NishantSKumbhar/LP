**Assignment 1&2 - BCT - Metamask**

# Metamask:
- Ethereum wallet which bridges gap between UI & Ethereum.
- Works in technology --> Web3.js
- Web3.js written by ethereum core team.
- Mainly used as a plugin in web browser.

# Installation Steps is known:

# Secret Key: bonus author carry endorse tennis please void skirt host panther electric drastic

# Ethereum:

- Ethereum is decentralized + Open Source Blockchain.
- Ethereum is Cryptocurrency.
- 2nd largest cryptocurrency in world.
- It also gives an edge for smart contract functionality.
- It is a program all above money.
- Unit of ethereum is --> 1 Ether = 1,08,832/- INR

1) Suppose, If we want to perform an operation.

4 + 4 = 8

Ethereum will tell you the ans is 8. But it will cost you 3 GAS.

2) Suppose, To check wallet balance, then it will cost you 400 GAS.

3) Suppose, Need some network for transaction in ether, then it will cost you 21,000 GAS.

# GAS --> It is basically a unit or measures the amount, that is required for the computational effort to perform any operation on ethereum network.

- Value of ethereum prices, doesn't affect the gas fees. Whether the value of ether is 2,000$ or 20,000$ it will always take 3 GAS for addition of 2 numbers.

# Q) How much it will truly cost?

Ans = Gas Cost x Gas Price

- here, Gas Cost doesn't change.
- here, Gas Price does change.

- Now, Comes the concept of GWEI - Giga Wei.

- Here, Wei is 1 penny or 1 satoshi.

- And, 1 Ether == One Quintillion Weis

- So, 1 GWEI = .000000001 ether

Let's Take an Example:

Suppose, we need to send money to my friend on ethereum.

So, What is it's actual transaction cost, apart from sending money???

# Things to know:
- Gas Value = 21,0000 GAS
- Price of 1 ether = 2,000$
- Suppose, GWEI = 100
- Now, what's the price of GAS?

Gas Value x GWEI 
= 21,000 x 100
= 21,000 x .00000000100 
= .0021 ethereum to send money.

Now, what's the amount in dollars?

.0021 x 2000 = 4.2$ Transaction fees.


**Assignment 3 - BCT - Smart Contract**

# Smart Contract:
- It is simply as the real-life contract.
- It follows the condition of --> if(this) then(that)
- It computer program is written, which works as an agreement between 2 parties.
- No involvement of 3rd-party.
- It is Distributed, Deterministic, secured, Immuatable.
- Drawback is also Immutable --> For any change need to create a new contract.
- Drawback is difficult to

EXAMPLE : KICKSTART
- Works between customers and company founders.
- Want an certain amount to be raised from people.
- If FUNDED successfully, people will be benefitted with reward.
- If not FUNDED successfully, people's money will be revert back.

**Assignment 4 - BCT - Solidity Program**

# Solidity:
- Brand-new Programming language.
- Mixture of CPP & Javascript.
- Created by ethereum developers.
- Runs of ethereum virtual machine.
- Smart contract written in solidity language.
- It doesn't provides output, it checks only whethere is compiled successfully or not.
- Direct deploy it.

# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):
- Run time environment for executing the smart contracts in blockchain.

**Assignment 5 - BCT - Survey report and Types of Blockchain**

# Blockchain:
- Decentralized and Distributed database.
- It is chain of blocks, which contains node and hashed values which is divided across entire network.

# Types of Blockhain:
- 3 types:

1) Public Blockchain:
- Anyone having access of internet, can be a part of public blockchain network.
- A user who is a part of public blockchain network, has authorized access to current and past records, & verify transactions of blockchain.

2) Private Blockchain:
- Permission restricted to a person, basically operative in closed network.
- Works usually within an organization, where only selected members are part of blockhain.

3) Consortium Blockchain:
- Semi-decentralized type where more than one organization manages blockchain netwwork.

4) Hybrid Blockchain:
- Combination of public and private blockchain.
- Private permission-based-system.
- Public permission-based-system.


**Assignment 6 - BCT - Hyperledger in blockchain**

# Hyperledger:
- Hyperledger is an open source project created to support the development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers
- Hyperledger consists of a collaborative effort to create the needed frameworks, standards, tools and libraries to build blockchains and related applications.
